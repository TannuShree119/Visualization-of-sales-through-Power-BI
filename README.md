# Exec Dashboard

The first slide of this project presents key metrics, including total revenue, profit, and number of orders. It features KPI cards that highlight the current month's statistics, providing a snapshot of the company's performance.

Additionally, the slide includes a line chart and a "Top N Products" section, offering insights into the company's performance over time. The use of eye-catching colors and a well-thought-out design ensures that the information is easy to understand and quickly grasped by viewers.
